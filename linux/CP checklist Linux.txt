Checklist
Read the readme

Note down which ports/users are allowed.

Do Forensics Questions

You may destroy the requisite information if you work on the checklist!

Secure root

set PermitRootLogin no in /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Secure Users

Disable the guest user.

Go to /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf and add the line

allow-guest=false

Then restart your session with sudo restart lightdm. This will log you out, so make sure you are not executing anything important.

Open up /etc/passwd and check which users

Are uid 0
Can login
Are allowed in the readme
Delete unauthorized users:

sudo userdel -r $user

sudo groupdel $user

Check /etc/sudoers.d and make sure only members of group sudo can sudo.

Check /etc/group and remove non-admins from sudo and admin groups.

Check user directories.

cd /home
sudo ls -Ra *
Look in any directories which show up for media files/tools and/or "hacking tools."
Enforce Password Requirements.

Add or change password expiration requirements to /etc/login.defs.

PASS_MIN_DAYS 7
PASS_MAX_DAYS 90
PASS_WARN_AGE 14
Add a minimum password length, password history, and add complexity requirements.

Open /etc/pam.d/common-password with sudo.
Add minlen=8 to the end of the line that has pam_unix.so in it.
Add remember=5 to the end of the line that has pam_unix.so in it.
Locate the line that has pam.cracklib.so in it. If you cannot find that line, install cracklib with sudo apt-get install libpam-cracklib.
Add ucredit=-1 lcredit=-1 dcredit=-1 ocredit=- to the end of that line.
Implement an account lockout policy.

Open /etc/pam.d/common-auth.
Add deny=5 unlock_time=1800 to the end of the line with pam_tally2.so in it.
Change all passwords to satisfy these requirements.

chpasswd is very useful for this purpose.

Enable automatic updates

In the GUI set Update Manager->Settings->Updates->Check for updates:->Daily.

Secure ports

sudo ss -ln
If a port has 127.0.0.1:$port in its line, that means it's connected to loopback and isn't exposed. Otherwise, there should only be ports which are specified in the readme open (but there probably will be tons more).
For each open port which should be closed:
sudo lsof -i :$port
Copy the program which is listening on the port. whereis $program
Copy where the program is (if there is more than one location, just copy the first one). dpkg -S $location
This shows which package provides the file (If there is no package, that means you can probably delete it with rm $location; killall -9 $program). sudo apt-get purge $package
Check to make sure you aren't accidentally removing critical packages before hitting "y".
sudo ss -l to make sure the port actually closed.
Secure network

Enable the firewall

sudo ufw enable

Enable syn cookie protection

sysctl -n net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies

Disable IPv6 (Potentially harmful)

echo "net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf

Disable IP Forwarding

echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

Prevent IP Spoofing

echo "nospoof on" | sudo tee -a /etc/host.conf

Install Updates

Start this before half-way.

Do general updates.

sudo apt-get update.
sudo apt-get upgrade.
Update services specified in readme.

Google to find what the latest stable version is.
Google "ubuntu install service version".
Follow the instructions.
Ensure that you have points for upgrading the kernel, each service specified in the readme, and bash if it is vulnerable to shellshock.

Configure services

Check service configuration files for required services. Usually a wrong setting in a config file for sql, apache, etc. will be a point.

Ensure all services are legitimate.

service --status-all
